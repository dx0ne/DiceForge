### Dice Rolling Helper Application - Developer Brief

#### Overview
This application is a dice rolling helper designed to facilitate custom dice creation, rolling, and organization on a grid. It includes functionalities for creating dice with custom faces, rolling dice using specified formulas, and organizing results on a grid for strategic planning and analysis.

#### Features

1. **Dice Formula Input**
   - A text input field where users can define their dice formulas (e.g., "blue 2d6, red 1d8, dZ"). It can be parsed as follows: color, number of dice, and type of die.
   - A roll button to execute the dice roll according to the specified formula.

2. **Roll Result Display**
   - A section that displays the result of the dice roll. Each die result is shown as an icon or number within a colored die face.
   - Two buttons below the roll result:
     - "Drop All to Shelf": Moves all dice results to the shelf.
     - "Reroll All": Rerolls all dice currently in the roll result section.

3. **Dice Shelf**
   - A area where users can drag and drop dice from the roll result to lock them from rerolls.
   - Each dice slot on the shelf can be cleared individually by an "X" button.
   - A "Clear Shelf" button to remove all dice from the shelf.

4. **Dice Forge**
   - A section to define custom dice faces using emojis or numbers.
   - Examples:
     - `dA: [1,1,2,2,3,3]`
     - `dB: [+, -]`
     - `dZ: [üëΩ,üëΩ,üëæ,ü¶ñ,üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]`
   - An input field for users to create their own dice labels with corresponding faces.

5. **Dice Grid**
   - A grid where users can drag and drop dice from the roll result or the shelf.
   - This grid allows for organizing dice in a structured manner for further analysis or gameplay.

#### User Interface Flow

2. **Rolling Dice**

   - Results are displayed in the Roll Result section with options to move all to the shelf or reroll.

3. **Organizing Dice**
   - Users drag and drop dice from the Roll Result to the Shelf to lock them.
   - Dice can be further organized on the Dice Grid for strategic planning.

4. **Clearing and Rerolling**
   - The Shelf can be cleared individually or entirely using the provided buttons.
   - Dice in the Roll Result section can be rerolled with the "Reroll All" button.

#### Developer Notes
